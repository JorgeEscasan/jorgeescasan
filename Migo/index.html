        <h1>Say Hello to Migo!</h1>
        <h2>The way people used computers yesterday, today.</h2>
            <p class=but>(But easier)</p>  
        <h3>What is Migo?</h3>
        <p>Migo is an interactive easy-to-use command prompt that anyone can use. 
        No programming knowledge necessary.</p>
        <h3>Why do I need Migo? Can't I just click on stuff?</h3>
        <p>Maybe, but using Migo allows you to develop a better understanding of how computers work
        and allows you to increase your functionality when using a computer.</p>
        <h3>So how does Migo work?</h3>
        <p>Migo does whatever you tell it to, for example, if you were to tell Migo
        "I want to listen to music", Migo would open iTunes. Likewise, if you were to tell Migo 
        "What is inside ____" Migo would show you the contents of the folder you named.</p>
