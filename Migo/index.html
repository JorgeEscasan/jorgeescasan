        <h1>Say Hello to Migo!</h1>
        
        <h2>The way people used computers yesterday, today.</h2>
        
            <p class=but>(But easier)</p>  
            
        <h3>What is Migo?</h3>
        
        <p>Migo is an interactive, easy-to-use command line that anyone can use. 
        No programming knowledge necessary.</p>
        
        <h3>Why do I need Migo? Can't I just click on stuff?</h3>
        
        <p>Maybe, but using Migo allows you to develop a better understanding of how computers work
        and allows you to increase your functionality when using a computer.</p>
        
        <h3>So how does Migo work?</h3>
        
        <p>Simply tell Migo what you want to do and Migo will do it for you!</p>
        
        <h3>What OS does Migo work with?</h3>
        
        <p>As of right now Migo is in its testing phase for OSX, once Migo for Mac is stable, 
        I will begin to work on versions for Linux and Windows.</p>
